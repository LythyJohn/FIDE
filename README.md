# FIDE
FIDE is a Forensic Internet Data Extractor from Google Chrome that is installed on Windows 7. 

It is written in Python3.6 and at this point is required to be on Windows 7 although Windows 8 and 10 shouldnt be an issue.
It can only read Google Chrome.

I have attempted to make all dependencies as adaptable as I can however some small variable tweeking may be needed.
